# 🛡️ The Steward's Covenant (Terms of Service)

**Last Updated:** December 26, 2025

---

Welcome to the Verse Guard Sanctuary. By installing the Verse Guard extension or using the Verse Guard website, you (the "Steward") enter into this covenant. This agreement ensures that our community remains a place of focus, growth, and integrity.

---

## 1. The Grant of Stewardship (License)

Verse Guard grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the extension for your own personal growth.

**The Guardrail:** You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our services or included software.

**No Reverse Engineering:** You agree not to attempt to extract the source code of the extension or the logic behind the Steward AI prompts. These are the "Sacred Trade Secrets" of the Verse Guard mission.

---

## 2. Age Requirement

You must be at least **13 years of age** to use Verse Guard. If you are using Student Mode, a parent or guardian must set up and supervise the account.

---

## 3. The Use of "The Steward" (AI Usage)

The Steward AI is a tool for guidance and productivity, **not** a replacement for professional, legal, or spiritual counsel.

**Rate Limits:** To ensure fair access for all, we enforce rate limits on AI requests. Attempting to bypass these limits via bots or scripts is a breach of this covenant.

**Content Policy:** You agree not to use The Steward to generate harmful, illegal, or deceptive content.

---

## 4. Intellectual Property & Brand

- **Verse Guard™**, the Golden Sigil, and the unique functionality of the **Witness Stone** and **Space of Grace** are the intellectual property of Verse Guard.
- The "look and feel" of the Sanctuary is protected by copyright.
- **Scripture:** Biblical texts used within the app are the property of their respective copyright holders (e.g., Biblica, Crossway). We provide these under "fair use" for personal meditation and study.

---

## 5. Subscription & The "Vanguard" Status

**Refunds:** We handle refunds through our payment processor (Lemon Squeezy). Refunds are available within **14 days** of purchase. Upon refund, your Premium status will be automatically revoked via our automated infrastructure.

**Lifetime Price Lock:** Vanguard Founders who use the `GENESIS` code are guaranteed their initial price point for the life of the product, provided the subscription remains active.

---

## 6. Limitation of Liability

Verse Guard is a tool to assist in self-discipline. **We do not guarantee specific outcomes**, and we are not liable for any digital or personal setbacks that occur while using or failing to use the tool. 

**TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW**, Verse Guard shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the service.

We provide the "Shield," but the Steward must carry it.

---

## 7. Termination of Covenant

We reserve the right to revoke access to Verse Guard (especially Premium features) if a user is found to be:

- Attacking our infrastructure
- Harassing the community
- Violating the "No Reverse Engineering" clause
- Abusing AI rate limits or payment systems

---

## 8. Governing Law

This agreement is governed by the laws of **England and Wales**. Any disputes arising from this covenant shall be resolved in the courts of England and Wales.

---

## 9. Changes to This Covenant

We may update these terms at any time. Material changes will be communicated through extension updates or email (if provided). **Continued use of Verse Guard 30 days after notification constitutes acceptance** of the updated terms.
