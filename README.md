## 🎯 What is Verse Guard?

**Verse Guard** is a Chrome extension that helps Christians cultivate intentional, Christ-centered internet use. Unlike typical content blockers that simply restrict access, Verse Guard transforms moments of temptation into opportunities for spiritual reflection and growth.

When you visit a blocked site, instead of seeing a cold "Access Denied" message, you're greeted with encouraging Scripture, space to reflect, and tools to help you redirect your focus.

> 🌍 **Open to Everyone**: While built on Christian wisdom, Verse Guard welcomes seekers, agnostics, and anyone tired of how the internet exploits attention. The principles of purity, focus, and self-control are universal.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

1. **Redemptive, not punitive** — Blocks become spiritual opportunities
2. **Discipleship, not deprivation** — You can bypass with friction, because character can't be coded
3. **Solidarity, not surveillance** — Partners see summaries, not browsing history
4. **Gamification with purpose** — XP rewards tied to genuine spiritual habits
5. **Beautiful by default** — Dark mode first, 15 color themes
6. **Season-aware** — Festive themes that auto-activate during holidays
7. **Fences for children, compasses for adults** — Student Mode removes choice; adult mode adds friction

## 📊 Privacy: You're the Customer, Not the Product

Unlike other "free" blockers that sell your browsing data, **Verse Guard is ministry-first**:

- **🏠 Local-first storage** — Your data stays on YOUR device
- **🚫 No data sales** — We never sell to brokers, advertisers, or hedge funds
- **🔒 Confidential reflections** — Your struggles are sacred, not marketing data
- **💳 Funded by you** — Premium subscriptions, not exploitation
- **✅ Manifest V3** — Built on Chrome's latest privacy standard

> *"Free" blockers aren't really free. If you're not paying, you're being sold.*
