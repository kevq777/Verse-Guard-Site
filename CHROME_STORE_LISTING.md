## Detailed Description (Full Listing)

### 🛡️ TRANSFORM YOUR DIGITAL LIFE

**Verse Guard** isn't just another content blocker—it's your companion for intentional, Christ-centered internet use.

When temptation strikes, Verse Guard doesn't just say "No." It says "Here's something better." Every blocked page becomes a moment for Scripture, reflection, and spiritual growth.

### 💡 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

Unlike typical content blockers that simply say "No," Verse Guard transforms temptation into opportunity:

1. **Redemptive, not punitive** — Blocks become spiritual growth opportunities
2. **Solidarity, not surveillance** — Partners see summaries of victories and progress, never browsing history
3. **Gamification with purpose** — XP rewards tied to genuine spiritual habits
4. **Beautiful by default** — Modern interface that inspires, not intimidates

### 🔐 PRIVACY PROMISE: WE SERVE YOU, NOT ADVERTISERS

Unlike other "free" blockers that sell your browsing data to brokers and advertisers, **Verse Guard is a ministry-first project**.

**🏠 Local-First Architecture**
Your browsing history is analyzed locally on YOUR device—never sent to a cloud server to be mined.

**🚫 No Data Sales**
We NEVER sell your data to brokers, advertisers, or hedge funds. Period.

**🔒 Confidential Reflections**
Your reflection logs and Shield Partner reports are strictly for your spiritual growth—not marketing profiles.

**💳 Funded by You, Not Exploitation**
We're funded by user subscriptions (Premium), not by exploiting your data. When you pay for Verse Guard, **you're the customer, not the product**.

**✅ Built on Manifest V3**
Verse Guard uses Chrome's latest privacy standard. You can inspect our network requests—we only communicate with our secure database for Account Sync and Shield Partner features.

*"Free" blockers aren't really free. If you're not paying, you're being sold.*
